= Releasing Kiali UI

Kiali is released using a Jenkins Pipeline. The main document covering
the release process can be found
link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/RELEASING.adoc[here].

Currently, the Pipeline only supports doing _minor_ releases and will
publish the UI, the backend and the Docker images all together.

== Running the release process locally

If you don't have access to the Jenkins instance or the release process
through Jenkins doesn't suit your needs, you may want to run the release
process _locally_.

This guide covers releasing only kiali-ui.

=== Requirements

You must have write permissions to the kiali-ui public GitHub repository in
order to be able to push the tags. You will also need an NPM account that
is able to publish to the NPM @kiali organization.

You will need a working dev environment for kaili-ui (git, npm, yarn, etc).
You will also need the following tools available in your $PATH:

* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] - a JSON processor used to update the
  package.json file
* https://github.com/fsaintjacques/semver-tool[semver] shell utility - used
  to update version numbers
* make - to run the release process
* curl - because the release process places PRs using the GitHub API

If you want the release process to push a PR for you to prepare the code for
the next release, you will need a GitHub Token for your account.

It's assumed that you are running the release process in you fork of the
kiali-ui repository.

=== Making the release

. Login to NPM using the user with write access to the NPM @kiali organization:
** `npm login`
. Checkout the code that you want to release:
** `git checkout branch_to_release` (usually, you should release "master")
** Be advised that the release process will commit changes locally
. The version that is specified in `package.json` file is what will be used to
  publish to NPM. If needed, modify the version numbers.
. If you want the release process to create a PR for you to prepare the code
  for the next version:
** `export GH_TOKEN={your_github_token}`
** A branch is always created in your fork of the code. So, if you don't have
   a token, you can place the PR manually.
. Run the release process:
** `make -f Makefile.jenkins release`

=== Available options

* If you want to make a "dry-run" of the release:
** `NPM_DRY_RUN=y make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
* It's assumed that you are doing a major or a minor release. So, a new 
  version branch is created in the kiali-ui repository (the branch name
  is like "vMAJOR.MINOR"). You can omit the creation of this branch:
** `OMIT_VERSION_BRANCH=y make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
* The release process bumps the minor part of the version specified in
  package.json. If this doesn't meet your needs, you can specify what will be the next version, so that the PR is created correctly:
** `UI_BUMPED_VERSION="major.minor.patch" make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
* The release process always creates a branch in your repository with the
  required changes to prepare the code for the next release. By default, the
  name of the branch is _prepare_next_version_. If you want to customize the
  name of the branch:
** `BUMP_BRANCH_ID={branch_name} make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
* If your NPM account don't have write privileges to the @kiali organization but
  you have a token with the required privileges, you can use that token:
** `NPM_TOKEN="{your_token}" make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
